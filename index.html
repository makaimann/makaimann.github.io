  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <img src="img/makai.jpg" style="width:512px;height:384px;">
  <p>I am Technical Staff at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, primarily focused on algorithms for assured autonomy. I completed my PhD in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University advised by <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~barrett/">Professor Clark Barrett</a> in the Computer Science Department. My thesis developed techniques for improving Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) based model checking scalability for hardware and software verification by automatically and soundly augmenting the model to be verified. I am currently investigating how formal methods, control theory, and learning can be used to produce trustworthy cyber-physical systems. More generally, I'm interested in safe and reliable automation, whether that be automated design approaches or autonomous systems. I am also fascinated by optimization theory, signal processing, causality, and computer graphics. I received a B.S. in Systems Science and Engineering from Washington University in St. Louis and a M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University.</p>
